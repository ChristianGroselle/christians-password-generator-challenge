# christians-password-generator-challenge


## Description

This project focused on adding functinality to a password generator.

This was done by:

-Collecting input data from the user about the desired password\
-Utilizing javaScript to process the data and validate it\
-Building a javaScript function to generate a random password based on the user's input\

This was done because:

-password security is important\
-The password generator was not functional in its base state\
